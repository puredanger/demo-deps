demo-deps
========================================

This project demonstrates an example project and how to use `clj` and the `deps.edn` file
to manage a simple project. The code here is a single namespace with some simple functions.
The functions use the clj-time library.

The deps.edn file contains a basic setup and some common aliases:

```clojure
{:paths ["src"]

 :deps
 {clj-time {:mvn/version "0.14.2"}}

 :aliases
 {
   ;; test src
   :test {:extra-paths ["test"]}

   ;; test.check 
   :check {:extra-deps {org.clojure/test.check {:mvn/version "0.9.0"}}}

   ;; benchmarking
   :bench {:extra-deps {criterium {:mvn/version "0.4.4"}}}}
}
```

### Running a REPL

The primary project classpath includes the following:

* Clojure (from ~/.clojure/deps.edn)
* The local source directory
* clj-time, an external Maven dependency

To run a repl, call `clj` with no other arguments. This will create and cache the classpath (for later executions) and start the repl.

```shell
$ clj
Clojure 1.9.0
user=> (require '[demo :as demo] '[clj-time.core :as time])
nil
user=> (str (demo/tomorrow (time/now)))
"2017-09-02T20:50:56.413Z"
```

### Running tests

This project includes specs and a test namespace that run the `stest/check` generative test runner for those specs. Here's the test namespace (stored at test/test_demo.clj):

```clojure
(ns test-demo
  (:require [demo :refer :all]
            [clojure.spec.test.alpha :as stest]))

(-> 'demo stest/enumerate-namespace stest/check stest/summarize-results)
```

To run these tests you need to include two additional things on your classpath:

1) The test source directory (here, `test`)
2) The `test.check` library

These are added in the `:test` and `:check` aliases and can be added to the classpath by activating the aliases:

```shell
clj -R:check -C:test
```

However, we don't really want a REPL, we just want to run the tests. The `clj` script is running `clojure.main` and you can get the full rundown on available options with `clj -h`. One option is `-e` which can be used to run one or more expressions specified as an argument. That's sufficient for our needs - just loading the namespace is enough to run the tests. 

```shell
$ clj -R:check -C:test -e "(require 'test-demo) (shutdown-agents)"

{:sym demo/days-between}
{:sym demo/tomorrow}
```

One special case here is that `stest/check` runs tests in parallel using `pmap`, and thus activates the background thread pool. Those threads are kept alive for one minute by default - we call `shutdown-agents` to shutdown them down and allow the Clojure runtime to exit immediately.

### Benchmarking

If you want to benchmark some code, you might include an external library just for that use, like `criterium`. We've included an alias `:bench` to add this dependency.

```shell
$ clj -R:bench
Clojure 1.9.0
user=> (use 'criterium.core 'demo 'clj-time.core)
user=> (def d (clj-time.core/now))
user=> (quick-bench (tomorrow d))
Evaluation count : 20542836 in 6 samples of 3423806 calls.
             Execution time mean : 31.741978 ns
    Execution time std-deviation : 1.890868 ns
   Execution time lower quantile : 30.409056 ns ( 2.5%)
   Execution time upper quantile : 34.613113 ns (97.5%)
                   Overhead used : 1.854455 ns
```

### Creating and deploying artifacts

`clj` is designed to do two things: make classpaths and run Clojure programs. Thus, this is not something that `clj` does or will provide. We recommend using one of the many Clojure build tools like `Leiningen`, `Boot`, `Maven`, etc.
